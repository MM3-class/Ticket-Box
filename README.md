Form Validation with Vue.js
it's really very Important to roll your own form validations. This can be done with a simple method call on the form submit, or a computed property evaluating input data on each change.
Using your form validation can quickly become cumbersome and annoying, however, especially when the number of inputs in the form increase, or the form structure gets more complicated e.g. multi-step forms. I made this Web Application for Validate:

-Validation<br>
-Multi-step form validation
-Child component validation
-Error messages
